# practice
This repo contains various practice projects undertaken to improve python skills. It is meant to be a record of my progress in python.

Structure:
The repository will contain individual folders for each task that is undertaken. Each folder will contain the python script for the task and a txt file describing the task. Within the txt file, I will also provide my difficulty rating for the task on a D to S scale (D being the easiest and S being the toughest).
